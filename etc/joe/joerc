                         Initialization file for JOE
                                Standard Joe

 JOE looks for this file in:
	1 - $HOME/.joerc
	2 - /etc/joe/joerc

 This file can include other files by placing the following include command
 in the first column:

 :include filename

		For normal xterm cut and paste, hold the shift key down.

 -joexterm	If you are using XTerm version 212 or higher, and if it was
		configured with --enable-paste64, set this flag: it allows
		mouse cut & paste to work properly (text selected with the
		mouse can be pasted into other application, and middle
		button clicks paste into JOE).

-brpaste	When JOE starts, send command to the terminal emulator that
		enables "bracketed paste mode" (but only if the terminal
		seems to have the ANSI command set).  In this mode, text
		pasted into the window is bracketed with ESC [ 2 0 0 ~ and

 Status line definition strings.  -lmsg defines the left-justified string and
 -rmsg defines the right-justified string.  The first character of -rmsg is
 the background fill character.  The following escape sequences can be used
 in these strings:

  %t  12 hour time
  %u  24 hour time
  %T  O for overtype mode, I for insert mode
  %W  W if wordwrap is enabled
  %I  A if autoindent is enabled

 Key sequence hints which are displayed in various prompts.
-aborthint ^C
-helphint ^K H

 SECOND SECTION: File name dependant local option settings:

 Name a file type definition section with:

   [python]  (but put opening bracket in first column)

 Each line with '*' in the first column provides a file name matching
 regular expression (in shell glob format).  If more than one regular
 expression matches the file name, then the last matching one is chosen.

 A file contents regular expression may also be specified on a separate line
 with '+regex'.  If this regular expresssion is given, then both the file name
 regex and the file contents regex must match for the options to apply.

 Here are the modes which can be set:

	-cpara >#!;*/%
				Characters which can indent paragraphs.

	-cnotpara .
				Characters which begin non-paragraph lines.

	-encoding name
				Set file coding (for example: utf-8, iso-8859-15)

	-syntax name
				Specify syntax (syntax file called
				'name.jsf' will be loaded)

	-hex			Hex editor mode

	-highlight		Enable highlighting

	-smarthome		Home key first moves cursor to beginning of line,
				then if hit again, to first non-blank character.

	-indentfirst		Smart home goes to first non-blank character first,
				instead of going the beginning of line first.

	-smartbacks		Backspace key deletes 'istep' number of
				'indentc's if cursor is at first non-space
				character.

	-tab nnn		Tab width

	-indentc nnn		Indentation character (32 for space, 9 for tab)

	-istep nnn		Number of indentation columns

	-spaces			TAB inserts spaces instead of tabs.

	-purify			Fix indentation if necessary for rindent, lindent and backs
				(for example if indentation uses a mix of tabs and spaces,
				and indentc is space, indentation will be converted to all
				spaces).

	-crlf			File uses CR-LF at ends of lines

	-wordwrap		Wordwrap

	-nobackup		If you don't want backup file to be created

	-autoindent		Auto indent

	-overwrite		Overtype mode

        -picture                Picture mode (right arrow can go past end of lines)

	-lmargin nnn		Left margin

	-rmargin nnn		Right margin

	-flowed			Put one space after intermediate paragraph lines
				for support of flowed text.


	-french			One space after '.', '?' and '!' for wordwrap
				and paragraph reformat instead of two.  Joe
				does not change the spacing you give, but
				sometimes it must put spacing in itself.  This
				selects how much is inserted.

	-linums			Enable line numbers on each line

	-hiline			Highlight current line

	-rdonly			File is read-only

	-keymap name
				Keymap to use if not 'main'

	-lmsg			Status line definition strings-
	-rmsg			see previous section for more info.

	-mfirst macro
				Macro to execute on first modification
	-mnew macro
				Macro to execute when new files are loaded
	-mold macro
				Macro to execute when existing files are loaded
	-msnew macro
				Macro to execute when new files are saved
	-msold macro
				Macro to execute when existing files are saved

	Macros for the above options are in the same format as in the key
	binding section below- but without the key name strings.

	These define the language syntax for ^G (goto matching delimiter):

	-highlighter_context	Use the highlighter context for ^G

	-single_quoted		Text between '  ' should be ignored (this is
				not good for regular text since ' is
				normally used alone as an apostrophe)

	-no_double_quoted	Text between " " should not be ignored (useful
				for TeX).

	-c_comment		Text between /* */ should be ignored

	-cpp_comment		Text after // should be ignored

	-pound_comment		Text after # should be ignored

	-vhdl_comment		Text after -- should be ignored

	-semi_comment		Text after ; should be ignored

	-text_delimiters begin=end:if=elif=else=endif

				Define word delimiters

 Default local options
-highlight
-istep 4
-tab 2

 Perforce macro: use this macro (put in first column) to have joe "p4 edit"
 a file you're about to change.

 -mfirst if,"rdonly && joe(sys,\"p4 edit \",name,rtn)",then,mode,"o",msg,"executed \"p4 edit ",name,"\"",rtn,endif

 -mfirst if,"rdonly && joe(sys,\"p4 edit \",name,rtn)",then,reload,msg,"executed \"p4 edit ",name,"\"",rtn,endif

 File type table is now in a separate file.  You can copy this file to ~/.joe and customize it.

:include ftyperc

 SECOND and 1/2 SECTION: Option menu layout

	:defmenu name [macro]
			Defines a menu.
			The macro here is executed when the user hits backspace.

	macro string comment
			A menu entry.  Macro is any JOE macro- see "Macros:"
			below. String is the label to be used for the macro
			in the menu.  It is in the same format as the -lmsg
			and -rmsg options above.

			Two whitespace characters in a row begins a comment.
			Use '% ' for a leading space in the string.

 THIRD SECTION: Named help screens:

 Use \i to turn on/off inverse video
 Use \u to turn on/off underline
 Use \b to turn on/off bold
 Use \d to turn on/off dim
 Use \f to turn on/off flash
 Use \l to turn on/off italic

 Use \| to insert a spring: all springs in a given line are set to the same
 width such that the entire line exactly fits in the width of the screen (if
 it's not an exact multiple so that there are N spaces remaining, the
 rightmost N springs each get one extra space).  Hint: if you want vertical
 alignment, each line should have the same number of springs.

 Use the '-help_is_utf8' global option to allow UTF-8 sequences in the help
 text.  Otherwise, the locale 8-bit character set is assumed.

 FOURTH SECTION: Key bindings:

 Section names you must provide:

	:main		For editing window
	:prompt		For prompt lines
	:query		For single-character query lines
	:querya		Singe-character query for quote
	:querysr	Search & Replace single-character query
	:shell		For shell windows
	:vtshell	For terminal emulator windows

 Other sections may be given as well for organization purposes or for
 use with the '-keymap' option.

 Use:
 :inherit name		To copy the named section into the current one
 :delete key		To delete a key sequence from the current section

 Keys:

 Use U+12345 for specific unicode character
 Use ^@ through ^_ and ^? for Ctrl chars
 Use SP for space
 Use a TO b to generate a range of characters
 Use MDOWN, MDRAG, MUP, M2DOWN, M2DRAG, M2UP, M3DOWN, M3DRAG, M3UP for mouse
 Use MWDOWN, MWUP for wheel mouse motion
 Use ^# for 0x9B (for Amiga).  But warning: this breaks UTF-8 keyboards.

 You can also use termcap string capability names.  For example:

	.ku		Up
	.kd		Down
	.kl		Left
	.kr		Right
	.kh		Home
	.kH		End
	.kI		Insert
	.kD		Delete
	.kP		PgUp
	.kN		PgDn
	.k1 - .k9	F1 - F9
	.k0		F0 or F10
	.k;		F10

 Macros:

 Simple macros can be made by comma seperating 2 or more command names.  For
 example:

 eof,bol	^T Z		Goto beginning of last line

 Also quoted matter is typed in literally:

 bol,">",dnarw	.k1		Quote news article line

 Macros may cross lines if they end with ,

 Commands or named macros may be created with :def.  For example, you can
 use:

 :def foo eof,bol

 To define a command foo which will goto the beginning of the last line.
