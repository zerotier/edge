or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

.SH NAME
casinh,
casinhf,
casinhl
\(em complex arc hyperbolic sine functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <complex.h>
.P

float complex casinhf(float complex \fIz\fP);
long double complex casinhl(long double complex \fIz\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the complex arc hyperbolic sine of
.IR z ,
with branch cuts outside the interval [\(mi\fIi\fR,\ +\fIi\fR] along
the imaginary axis.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
These functions shall return the complex arc hyperbolic sine value, in
the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the real axis and
in the interval [\(mi\fIi\fR\(*p/2,\ +\fIi\fR\(*p/2] along the
imaginary axis.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
