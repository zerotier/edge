The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

#include <math.h>
.P
double fma(double \fIx\fP, double \fIy\fP, double \fIz\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute (\fIx\fR\ *\ \fIy\fR)\ +\ \fIz\fR,
rounded as one ternary operation: they shall compute the value (as if)
to infinite precision and round once to the result format, according to
the rounding mode characterized by the value of FLT_ROUNDS.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
(\fIx\fR\ *\ \fIy\fR)\ + \fIz\fR, rounded as one ternary operation.
.P
If the result overflows or underflows, a range error may occur.
On systems that support the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, if the
result overflows a range error shall occur.
.P
If
.IR x
or
.IR y
are NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
multiplied by
.IR y
is an exact infinity and
.IR z
is also an infinity but with the opposite sign, a domain error shall
occur, and either a NaN (if supported), or an implementation-defined
value shall be returned.
.P
If one of
.IR x
and
.IR y
is infinite, the other is zero, and
.IR z
is not a NaN, a domain error shall occur, and either a NaN (if
supported), or an implementation-defined value shall be returned.
.P
If one of
.IR x
and
.IR y
is infinite, the other is zero, and
.IR z
is a NaN, a NaN shall be returned and a domain error may occur.
.P
If
.IR x *\c
.IR y
is not 0*Inf nor Inf*0 and
.IR z
is a NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x *\c
.IR y +\c
.IR z
is invalid, or the value
.IR x *\c
.IR y
is invalid and
.IR z
is not a NaN.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result overflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.br

non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .

.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
In many cases, clever use of floating (\fIfused\fR) multiply-add leads
to much improved code; but its unexpected use by the compiler can
undermine carefully written code. The FP_CONTRACT macro can be used to
disallow use of floating multiply-add; and the
\fIfma\fR()
function guarantees its use where desired. Many current machines
provide hardware floating multiply-add instructions; software
implementation can be used for others.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
