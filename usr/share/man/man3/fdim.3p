.SH PROLOG
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

.SH NAME
fdim,
fdimf,
fdiml
\(em compute positive difference between two floating-point numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double fdim(double \fIx\fP, double \fIy\fP);
float fdimf(float \fIx\fP, float \fIy\fP);
long double fdiml(long double \fIx\fP, long double \fIy\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall determine the positive difference between their
arguments. If
.IR x
is greater than
.IR y ,
.IR x \(mi\c
.IR y
is returned. If
.IR x
is less than or equal to
.IR y ,
+0 is returned.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the positive
difference value.
.P
If
.IR x \(mi\c
.IR y
is positive and overflows, a range error shall occur and
\fIfdim\fR(),
\fIfdimf\fR(),
and
\fIfdiml\fR()
shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, and HUGE_VALL,
respectively.
.P
If the correct value would cause underflow, a range error may occur, and
\fIfdim\fR(),
\fIfdimf\fR(),
and
\fIfdiml\fR()
shall return
the correct value, or
(if the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option is not supported) an
implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude than DBL_MIN,
FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
or
.IR y
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIfdim\fR()
function shall fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result overflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
The
\fIfdim\fR()
function may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result underflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
