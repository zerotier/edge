.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR stty
utility shall set or report on terminal I/O characteristics for the
device that is its standard input. Without options or operands
specified, it shall report the settings of certain characteristics,
usually those that differ from implementation-defined defaults.
Otherwise, it shall modify the terminal state according to the
specified operands. Detailed information about the modes listed in the
first five groups below are described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Chapter 11" ", " "General Terminal Interface".
Operands in the Combination Modes group (see
.IR "Combination Modes")
are implemented using operands in the previous groups. Some
combinations of operands are mutually-exclusive on some terminal types;
the results of using such combinations are unspecified.
.P
Typical implementations of this utility require a communications line
configured to use the
.BR termios
interface defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008. On systems where none of these lines
are available, and on lines not currently configured to support the
.BR termios
interface, some of the operands need not affect terminal
characteristics.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.IR stty
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 12.2" ", " "Utility Syntax Guidelines".
.P
The following options shall be supported:
.IP "\fB\(mia\fP" 10
Write to standard output all the current settings for the terminal.
.IP "\fB\(mig\fP" 10
Write to standard output all the current settings in an unspecified
form that can be used as arguments to another invocation of the
.IR stty
utility on the same system. The form used shall not contain any
characters that would require quoting to avoid word expansion by the
shell; see
.IR "Section 2.6" ", " "Word Expansions".

characteristics.

.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
.BR \(mig
flag is designed to facilitate the saving and restoring of terminal
state from the shell level. For example, a program may:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
saveterm="$(stty \(mig)"       # save terminal state
stty \fI(new settings)\fR         # set new state
\&...                         # ...
stty $saveterm              # restore terminal state
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
Since the format is unspecified, the saved value is not portable across
systems.
.P
Since the
.BR \(mia
format is so loosely specified, scripts that save and restore terminal
settings should use the
.BR \(mig
option.
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH RATIONALE
The original
.IR stty
description was taken directly from System V and reflected the System V
terminal driver
.BR termio .
It has been modified to correspond to the terminal driver
.BR termios .
.P
Output modes are specified only for XSI-conformant systems. All
implementations are expected to provide
.IR stty
operands corresponding to all of the output modes they support.
.P
The
.IR stty
utility is primarily used to tailor the user interface of the terminal,
such as selecting the preferred ERASE and KILL characters. As an
application programming utility,
.IR stty
can be used within shell scripts to alter the terminal settings for the
duration of the script.
.P
The
.BR termios
section states that individual disabling of control characters is
possible through the option _POSIX_VDISABLE.
If enabled, two conventions currently exist for specifying this: System
V uses
.BR \(dq^\(mi\(dq ,
and BSD uses
.IR undef .
Both are accepted by
.IR stty
in this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008. The other BSD convention of using the letter
.BR 'u' 
was rejected because it conflicts with the actual letter
.BR 'u' ,
which is an acceptable value for a control character.
.P
Early proposals did not specify the mapping of
.BR \(dq^c\(dq 
to control characters because the control characters were not specified
in the POSIX locale character set description file requirements. The
control character set is now specified in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Chapter 3" ", " "Definitions",
so the historical mapping is specified. Note that although the mapping
corresponds to control-character key assignments on many terminals that
use the ISO/IEC\ 646:\|1991 standard (or ASCII) character encodings, the mapping specified
here is to the control characters, not their keyboard encodings.
.P
Since
.BR termios
supports separate speeds for input and output, two new options were
added to specify each distinctly.
.P
Some historical implementations use standard input to get and set
terminal characteristics; others use standard output. Since input from
a login TTY is usually restricted to the owner while output to a TTY is
frequently open to anyone, using standard input provides fewer chances
of accidentally (or maliciously) altering the terminal settings of
other users. Using standard input also allows
.IR stty
.BR \(mia
and
.IR stty
.BR \(mig
output to be redirected for later use. Therefore, usage of standard
input is required by this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008.
