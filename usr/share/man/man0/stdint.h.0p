.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdint.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Some of the functionality described on this reference page extends the
ISO\ C standard. Applications shall define the appropriate feature test macro
(see the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 2.2" ", " "The Compilation Environment")
to enable the visibility of these symbols in this header.
.P
The
.IR <stdint.h> 
header shall declare sets of integer types having specified widths, and
shall define corresponding sets of macros. It shall also define macros
that specify limits of integer types corresponding to types defined in
other standard headers.
.TP 10
.BR Note:
The ``width'' of an integer type is the number of bits used to store
its value in a pure binary system; the actual type may use more bits
than that (for example, a 28-bit type could be stored in 32 bits of
actual storage). An
.IR N -bit
signed type has values in the range \(mi2\s-3\u\fIN\fR\(mi1\d\s+3 or
1\(mi2\s-3\u\fIN\fR\(mi1\d\s+3 to 2\s-3\u\fIN\fR\(mi1\d\s+3\(mi1, while
an
.IR N -bit
unsigned type has values in the range 0 to 2\s-3\u\fIN\fR\d\s+3\(mi1.
.P
.P
Types are defined in the following categories:
.IP " *" 4
Integer types having certain exact widths
.IP " *" 4
Integer types having at least certain specified widths
.IP " *" 4
Fastest integer types having at least certain specified widths
.IP " *" 4
Integer types wide enough to hold pointers to objects
.IP " *" 4
Integer types having greatest width
.P
(Some of these types may denote the same type.)
.P
Corresponding macros specify limits of the declared types and construct
suitable constants.
.P
For each type described herein that the implementation provides, the
.IR <stdint.h> 
header shall declare that
.BR typedef
name and define the associated macros. Conversely, for each type
described herein that the implementation does not provide, the
.IR <stdint.h> 
header shall not declare that
.BR typedef
name, nor shall it define the associated macros. An implementation
shall provide those types described as required, but need not provide
any of the others (described as optional).
.SS "Integer Types"
.P
When
.BR typedef
names differing only in the absence or presence of the initial
.IR u
are defined, they shall denote corresponding signed and unsigned types
as described in the ISO/IEC\ 9899:\|1999 standard, Section 6.2.5; an implementation providing
one of these corresponding types shall also provide the other.
.P
In the following descriptions, the symbol
.IR N
represents an unsigned decimal integer with no leading zeros (for
example, 8 or 24, but not 04 or 048).
.IP " *" 4
Exact-width integer types
.RS 4 
.P
The
.BR typedef
name
.BR int \c
.IR N \c
.BR _t
designates a signed integer type with width
.IR N ,
no padding bits, and a two's-complement representation. Thus,
.BR int8_t
denotes a signed integer type with a width of exactly 8 bits.
.P
The
.BR typedef
name
.BR uint \c
.IR N \c
.BR _t
designates an unsigned integer type with width
.IR N .
Thus,
.BR uint24_t
denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 24 bits.
.P
The following types are required:
.P
.nf
.BR int8_t
.BR int16_t
.BR int32_t
.BR uint8_t
.BR uint16_t
.BR uint32_t
.fi
.P
If an implementation provides integer types with width 64 that
meet these requirements, then the following types are required:
.BR int64_t
.BR uint64_t
.P
In particular, this will be the case if any of the following are
true:
.IP -- 4
The implementation supports the _POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG programming
environment and the application is being built in the
_POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG programming environment (see the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR c99 ,

Minimum-width integer types
.RS 4 
.P
The
.BR typedef
name
.BR int_least \c
.IR N \c
.BR _t
designates a signed integer type with a width of at least
.IR N ,
such that no signed integer type with lesser size has at least the
specified width. Thus,
.BR int_least32_t
denotes a signed integer type with a width of at least 32 bits.
.P
The
.BR typedef
name
.BR uint_least \c
.IR N \c
.BR _t
designates an unsigned integer type with a width of at least
.IR N ,
such that no unsigned integer type with lesser size has at least the
specified width. Thus,
.BR uint_least16_t
denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of at least 16 bits.
.P
The following types are required:
.BR int_least8_t
.BR int_least16_t
.BR int_least32_t
.BR int_least64_t

Fastest minimum-width integer types
.RS 4 
.P
Each of the following types designates an integer type that is usually
fastest to operate with among all integer types that have at least the
specified width.
.P
The designated type is not guaranteed to be fastest for all purposes;
if the implementation has no clear grounds for choosing one type over
another, it will simply pick some integer type satisfying the
signedness and width requirements.
.P
The
.BR typedef
name
.BR int_fast \c
.IR N \c
.BR _t
designates the fastest signed integer type with a width of at least
.IR N .
The
.BR typedef
name
.BR uint_fast \c
.IR N \c
.BR _t
designates the fastest unsigned integer type with a width of at least

The following type designates a signed integer type with the property
that any valid pointer to

.BR void ,
and the result will compare equal to the original pointer:
.BR intptr_t

The following type designates an unsigned integer type with the
property that any valid pointer to

The

header is a subset of the
.IR <inttypes.h> 
header more suitable for use in freestanding environments, which might
not support the formatted I/O functions. In some environments, if the
formatted conversion support is not wanted, using this header instead
of the
.IR <inttypes.h> 
header avoids defining such a large number of macros.
