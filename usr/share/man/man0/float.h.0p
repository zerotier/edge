.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <float.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The characteristics of floating types are defined in terms of a model
that describes a representation of floating-point numbers and values
that provide information about an implementation's floating-point
arithmetic.
.P
The following parameters are used to define the model for each
floating-point type:
.IP "\fIs\fP" 6
Sign (\(+-1).
.IP "\fIb\fP" 6
Base or radix of exponent representation (an integer >1).
.IP "\fIe\fP" 6
Exponent (an integer between a minimum $e_ min$ and a maximum
$e_ max$).
.IP "\fIp\fP" 6
Precision (the number of base\(mi\fIb\fP digits in the significand).
.IP "$f_ k$" 6
Non-negative integers less than
.IR b
(the significand digits).
.P
A floating-point number
.IR x
is defined by the following model:
.P
.EQ
x  " "  =  " "  sb"^" e" "  " "  sum from k=1 to p^  " "  f_ k" "  " "  b"^" " "-k ,
     " "  e_ min" "  " "  <=  " "  e  " "  <=  " "  e_ max" "
.EN
.P
In addition to normalized floating-point numbers ($f_ 1$>0 if
.IR x \(!=0),
floating types may be able to contain other kinds of floating-point
numbers, such as subnormal floating-point numbers (\c
.IR x \(!=0,
.IR e =\c
$e_ min$, $f_ 1$=0) and unnormalized floating-point numbers (\c
.IR x \(!=0,
.IR e >\c
$e_ min$, $f_ 1$=0), and values that are not floating-point
numbers, such as infinities and NaNs. A
.IR NaN
is an encoding signifying Not-a-Number. A
.IR "quiet NaN"
propagates through almost every arithmetic operation without raising a
floating-point exception; a
.IR "signaling NaN"
generally raises a floating-point exception when occurring as an
arithmetic operand.
.P
An implementation may give zero and non-numeric values, such as
infinities and NaNs, a sign, or may leave them unsigned. Wherever such
values are unsigned, any requirement in POSIX.1\(hy2008 to retrieve the
sign shall produce an unspecified sign and any requirement to set the
sign shall be ignored.
.P
The accuracy of the floating-point operations (\c
.BR '+' ,
.BR '\(mi' ,
.BR '*' ,
.BR '/' )
and of the functions in
.IR <math.h> 
and
.IR <complex.h> 
that return floating-point results is implementation-defined, as is the
accuracy of the conversion between floating-point internal
representations and string representations performed by the functions
in
.IR <stdio.h> ,
.IR <stdlib.h> ,
and
.IR <wchar.h> .
The implementation may state that the accuracy is unknown.
.P
All integer values in the
.IR <float.h> 
header, except FLT_ROUNDS, shall be constant expressions suitable for
use in
.BR #if
preprocessing directives; all floating values shall be constant
expressions. All except DECIMAL_DIG, FLT_EVAL_METHOD, FLT_RADIX, and
FLT_ROUNDS have separate names for all three floating-point types. The
floating-point model representation is provided for all values except
FLT_EVAL_METHOD and FLT_ROUNDS.
.P
The rounding mode for floating-point addition is characterized by the
implementation-defined value of FLT_ROUNDS:
.IP "\(mi1" 6
Indeterminable.
.IP "\00" 6
Toward zero.
.IP "\01" 6
To nearest.
.IP "\02" 6
Toward positive infinity.
.IP "\03" 6
Toward negative infinity.
.P
All other values for FLT_ROUNDS characterize implementation-defined
rounding behavior.
.P
The values of operations with floating operands and values subject to
the usual arithmetic conversions and of floating constants are
evaluated to a format whose range and precision may be greater than
required by the type. The use of evaluation formats is characterized by
the implementation-defined value of FLT_EVAL_METHOD:
.IP "\(mi1" 6
Indeterminable.
.IP "\00" 6
Evaluate all operations and constants just to the range and
precision of the type.
.IP "\01" 6
Evaluate operations and constants of type
.BR float
and
.BR double
to the range and precision of the
.BR double
type; evaluate
.BR "long double"
operations and constants to the range and precision of the
.BR "long double"
type.
.IP "\02" 6
Evaluate all operations and constants to the range and precision of the
.BR "long double"
type.
.P
All other negative values for FLT_EVAL_METHOD characterize
implementation-defined behavior.
.P
The
.IR <float.h> 
header shall define the following values as constant expressions with
implementation-defined values that are greater or equal in magnitude
(absolute value) to those shown, with the same sign.

None.
.SH RATIONALE
All known hardware floating-point formats satisfy the property that the
exponent range is larger than the number of mantissa digits. The ISO\ C standard
permits a floating-point format where this property is not true, such that
the largest finite value would not be integral; however, it is unlikely
that there will ever be hardware support for such a floating-point format,
and it introduces boundary cases that portable programs should not have
to be concerned with (for example, a non-integral DBL_MAX means that
\fIceil\fR()
would have to worry about overflow). Therefore, this standard imposes
an additional requirement that the largest representable finite value
is integral.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
